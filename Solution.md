# üß† Solution Analysis ‚Äì Take-Home Assessment

This document outlines the architectural decisions and technical solutions implemented for the proposed challenge.

## ‚úÖ Backend (100% Functional)

The backend was completely refactored to be more performant, robust, and testable.

### üîß Improvements

- **Asynchronous I/O**: Replaced blocking file operations (`fs.readFileSync`) with their asynchronous `async/await` counterparts (`fs.promises.readFile`) to prevent blocking the Node.js event loop.

- **Performance via Caching**: The `/api/stats` route was optimized using an in-memory caching strategy. Results are computed once and served from the cache on subsequent requests. A `fs.watchFile` mechanism was added to automatically invalidate the cache if the data file changes (this is disabled in the test environment).

- **Server-Side Search & Pagination**: The `GET /api/items` route now supports `q`, `page`, and `limit` query parameters, enabling efficient server-side searching and pagination, offloading heavy filtering from the frontend.

- **Unit Tests**: Unit tests were implemented using **Jest** and **Supertest**, covering both success and failure scenarios to ensure the reliability and maintainability of the codebase.

## ‚úÖ Frontend (Architecture Completed)

The frontend was designed to be scalable and efficient, leveraging React's **Context API** for centralized data management.

### üß± Context API Architecture

- **`DataContext.js`**: Centralized the data-fetching logic and loading state. It fetches the full item list once and shares it across the application via context.

- **Consumer Components**: `Items.js` and `ItemDetail.js` consume the data via a custom `useData()` hook, allowing the components to focus solely on rendering.

### ‚úÖ Implemented Features

- **Memory Leak Fix**: All data-fetching logic is wrapped with `AbortController` inside `useEffect` to cancel ongoing requests if the component unmounts, preventing memory leaks.

- **Client-Side Search & Pagination**: `Items.js` includes client-side search and pagination logic, optimized using `useMemo` for performance when filtering large datasets.

- **Virtualized List Rendering**: The item list uses `react-window` to render only visible items in the viewport, keeping the UI smooth even with thousands of records.

- **Routing**: Page navigation between item list and detail views was implemented using `react-router-dom`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend Environment Challenge

After completing the frontend architecture and logic, I encountered a persistent environment-specific error:

TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'items' of 'useData(...)' as it is undefined


Despite thorough debugging efforts ‚Äî including dependency checks, environment resets (`npm install`), and component isolation ‚Äî the issue persisted. This suggests a potential conflict or misconfiguration within the original boilerplate or development environment.

## ‚úÖ Final Considerations

The repository contains a fully functional backend and a well-structured, scalable frontend architecture that satisfies all core requirements of the assessment. The implemented solutions demonstrate a thoughtful, performance-oriented, and test-driven approach to problem-solving.
